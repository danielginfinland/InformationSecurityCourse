## Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: Chapter 1: Foundations

- Plaintext is encrypted to ciphertext. The ciphertext is then decrypted to the original plaintext.
- encrypt = encipher
- decrypt = decipher

## Drug deals
Market places: 
- Cryptomarkets
- vendor shops
- drug image board
- closed messaging app groups

typical buyer is recreational user

high risk business: that why there also are some trust mechanics: 
- recommendations
- feedback
- escrow

average buyer thinks: 
- trading is anonymous in TOR-browsing
- excrow is not trust-worthy
- trust their small purchase sizes

trust
- image by the store (use right nickname - not same one as on Insta, Fb, Tinder, ...; good marketing)
- outright racism - only selling to Finns as a Finn
- convenience - rule of least effort

buyers: 
- ethnicity (only to countrymen)
- age - they do not sell to minors (ethical or because of hard punishment)
- language - right kind of language (enough spelling mistakes and the right use of slang) --> posts with no spelling mistakes are likely posts by law-enforcement ("Moi Coppo")

# a PGP

I followed the instruction by Tero Karvinen. 

First of all I updated my Linux applications. 

    $ sudo apt-get update

After that I installt gpg encryption tool. 

    sudo apt-get install gpg micro psmisc

After installation I created a key-pair. 

    $ gpg --gen-key

I have to secure it with a password.

Then I checked the fingerprint. 

    $ gpg --fingerprint

Original text: 
HDMH'B TH. KWU'YI AWR WSSTOTMJJK M OWQINYIMLIY! MB KWU BII, BTGPJI BUNBHTHUHTWA OTPDIYB OMA NI NYWLIA RTHD SYIEUIAOK MAMJKBTB. BII KWU MH DHHP://HIYWLMYCTAIA.OWG

First approach was to figure out what the most used letter in English textes is - the letter "E". This is most likely "I".
The text also contains a few words with apostrophs. I guess that the letter after the apostroph is most likely an "S". 

First letter is the ciphered text, second letter is the enciphered text. 

    B = S

There is also the apostroph with two letters after. This is most likely "RE". 

    Y = R
    I = E

Then there´s also a website with DHHP:// in the text. This is most likely "HTTP".

    D = H
    H = T

There´s the word "M" with only one letter - this could be either "A" or "I". 

    M = A/I

There´s the word "TH". "H" is T - so there´s the word is either "AT" or "IT".

    T = A/I

"BII" is then "SEE". The word "MH" is in front of the URL. "MH" is either "AT" or "IT". In my opinion it´s more likely that it´s "AT". 
So I assume the following: 

    M = A
    T = I

So all in all: 

    B = S
    Y = R
    I = E
    D = H
    H = T
    M = A
    T = I

First approach to read the correct text: 

THAT'S IT. KWU'RE AWR WSSIOIMJJK A OWQENREALER! AS KWU SEE, STGPJE SUNSHTHUHTWA OTPDERS OAA NE NRWLEA RTHD SREEUEAOK MAMJKSTS. SEE KWU AT HTTP://TERWLARCTAEA.OWG

"KWU" most likely is "YOU".

    K = Y
    W = O
    U = U
    
So: 

THAT'S IT. YOU'RE AOR OSSIOIMJJY A OWQENREALER! AS YOU SEE, STGPJE SUNSHTHUHTOA OTPDERS OAA NE NROLEA RTHD SREEUEAOK MAMJYSTS. SEE YOU AT HTTP://TEROLARCTAEA.OOG

The ending of the URL is xOy. That´s most likely "COM".

    O = C
    G = M

THAT'S IT. YOU'RE ACR OSSIOIMJJY A COQENREALER! AS YOU SEE, STGPJE SUNSHTHUHTOA OTPDERS OAA NE NROLEA RTHD SREEUEAOK MAMJYSTS. SEE YOU AT HTTP://TEROLARCTAEA.COM

The URL is probably TEROKARVINEN.COM.
So "LARCTAEA" is "KARVINEN".

    L = K
    C = V
    T = I
    A = N

THAT'S IT. YOU'RE AVR OSSIOIMJJY A CWQENREAKER! AS YOU SEE, STGPJE SUNSHTHUHTOA OTPDERS OAA NE NROLEA RTHD SREEUEAOK MAMJYSTS. SEE YOU AT HTTP://TEROKARVINEN.COM

    R = B
    Q = D

THAT'S IT. YOU'RE ACR OSSIOIMJJY A CODEBREAKER! AS YOU SEE, STGPJE SUNSHTHUHTOA OTPDERS OAA NE NROLEA RTHD SREEUEAOK MAMJYSTS. SEE YOU AT HTTP://TEROKARVINEN.COM   

    S = F
    J = L

THAT'S IT. YOU'RE ACR OFFICIALLY A CODEBREAKER! AS YOU SEE, STGPLE SUNSHTHUHTOA OTPDERS OAA NE NROLEA RTHD SREEUEAOK MAMLYSTS. SEE YOU AT HTTP://TEROKARVINEN.COM 


I didn´t switch all letters of the ciphertext with the original letters. I have to think of a clearer and more structured way of 
deciphering.
