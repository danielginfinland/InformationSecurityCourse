## Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: Chapter 1: Foundations

- Plaintext is encrypted to ciphertext. The ciphertext is then decrypted to the original plaintext.
- encrypt = encipher
- decrypt = decipher

## Drug deals
Market places: 
- Cryptomarkets
- vendor shops
- drug image board
- closed messaging app groups

typical buyer is recreational user

high risk business: that why there also are some trust mechanics: 
- recommendations
- feedback
- escrow

average buyer thinks: 
- trading is anonymous in TOR-browsing
- excrow is not trust-worthy
- trust their small purchase sizes

trust
- image by the store (use right nickname - not same one as on Insta, Fb, Tinder, ...; good marketing)
- outright racism - only selling to Finns as a Finn
- convenience - rule of least effort

buyers: 
- ethnicity (only to countrymen)
- age - they do not sell to minors (ethical or because of hard punishment)
- language - right kind of language (enough spelling mistakes and the right use of slang) --> posts with no spelling mistakes are likely posts by law-enforcement ("Moi Coppo")

# a PGP

I followed the instruction by Tero Karvinen. 

First of all I updated my Linux applications. 

    $ sudo apt-get update

![grafik](https://github.com/danielginfinland/InformationSecurityCourse/assets/156656492/6465a8b1-75aa-4882-a69c-1cb7c58bd557)

After that I installt gpg encryption tool. 

    sudo apt-get install gpg micro psmisc

![grafik](https://github.com/danielginfinland/InformationSecurityCourse/assets/156656492/a4ca041d-598c-4364-9f6a-f8e383f8eb5d)

After installation I created a key-pair. 

    $ gpg --gen-key

![grafik](https://github.com/danielginfinland/InformationSecurityCourse/assets/156656492/361127bd-1c57-4e79-98d8-4d686c94dcdf)

I have to secure it with a password. 

![grafik](https://github.com/danielginfinland/InformationSecurityCourse/assets/156656492/b26cd961-7469-42f9-bbe0-71375f7f8bd7)

![grafik](https://github.com/danielginfinland/InformationSecurityCourse/assets/156656492/4bef07ec-8b8b-4330-8054-654a75dbacc3)
    
Then I checked the fingerprint. 

    $ gpg --fingerprint

![grafik](https://github.com/danielginfinland/InformationSecurityCourse/assets/156656492/0478514e-93d4-4d9d-8509-a35cb98d4998)

The encryption method is like that: There´s a public and a secret key. The public key is printed in the screenshot above and can be shared with the receiver of the message.

Because Alice wants to send a message to me, I have to export the public key.

    $ cd
    $ gpg --export --armor --output daniel.pub

![grafik](https://github.com/danielginfinland/InformationSecurityCourse/assets/156656492/2fb46e4d-3f76-45b3-9766-22ec3a59b2ca)

It´s then saved in the file daniel.pub

    $ head -4 tero.pub 
    
![grafik](https://github.com/danielginfinland/InformationSecurityCourse/assets/156656492/5d2c7d69-7310-4812-8800-4e5c3f4f90ec)


Now we create the second person, Alice. 

    $ cd
    $ mkdir alice/
    $ chmod og-rwx alice/

![grafik](https://github.com/danielginfinland/InformationSecurityCourse/assets/156656492/dc3aa6e5-2f52-41f6-92a9-e6028514116d)

Through the following commands, we simulate Alice. 

    $ cd alice/
    $ gpg --homedir . --fingerprint
    $ gpg --homedir . --fingerprint

![grafik](https://github.com/danielginfinland/InformationSecurityCourse/assets/156656492/3f1b53ca-f2c5-45c2-a7be-31ba64204810)


No we create Alice´s own key-pair. 

![grafik](https://github.com/danielginfinland/InformationSecurityCourse/assets/156656492/ee65a079-021b-43b5-9b5c-5531598db0c5)

![grafik](https://github.com/danielginfinland/InformationSecurityCourse/assets/156656492/1419e63a-95c9-4ef7-817a-26098ee9a436)

We can see the public key with this command: 

    $ gpg --homedir . --fingerprint

When Alice wants to send a message to me, she needs my public key (daniel.pub). 

    $ cd
    $ cp -v tero.pub alice/

![grafik](https://github.com/danielginfinland/InformationSecurityCourse/assets/156656492/ab7597a3-27b2-442d-a08a-746e4ded0aae)

    $ cd alice/
    $ gpg --homedir . --import tero.pub

![grafik](https://github.com/danielginfinland/InformationSecurityCourse/assets/156656492/a7d6a65d-d5be-4a14-b4f4-2067ff7cdc8d)

With this command you can see, that it is indeed the right key. 
   
    $ gpg --homedir . --fingerprint

![grafik](https://github.com/danielginfinland/InformationSecurityCourse/assets/156656492/be3816c5-fc86-4381-b896-3f19730f82bf)

Now Alice wants to chat with me. To be sure that the line is secure we will ensure the key is right. 

    $ gpg --homedir . --sign-key "[insert the public key]"

![grafik](https://github.com/danielginfinland/InformationSecurityCourse/assets/156656492/7efd59aa-640c-462e-a8ae-854b27944ce2)

    $ gpg --homedir . --fingerprint

![grafik](https://github.com/danielginfinland/InformationSecurityCourse/assets/156656492/3e19ca8c-1e75-4694-bf17-96ec16de7898)


    $ gpg --homedir . --export --armor --output alice.pub
    $ cp -v alice/alice.pub .

    $ cd 
    $ cp -v alice/alice.pub .

    $ cd 
    $ cp -v alice/alice.pub .

Original text: 
HDMH'B TH. KWU'YI AWR WSSTOTMJJK M OWQINYIMLIY! MB KWU BII, BTGPJI BUNBHTHUHTWA OTPDIYB OMA NI NYWLIA RTHD SYIEUIAOK MAMJKBTB. BII KWU MH DHHP://HIYWLMYCTAIA.OWG

First approach was to figure out what the most used letter in English textes is - the letter "E". This is most likely "I".
The text also contains a few words with apostrophs. I guess that the letter after the apostroph is most likely an "S". 

First letter is the ciphered text, second letter is the enciphered text. 

    B = S

There is also the apostroph with two letters after. This is most likely "RE". 

    Y = R
    I = E

Then there´s also a website with DHHP:// in the text. This is most likely "HTTP".

    D = H
    H = T

There´s the word "M" with only one letter - this could be either "A" or "I". 

    M = A/I

There´s the word "TH". "H" is T - so there´s the word is either "AT" or "IT".

    T = A/I

"BII" is then "SEE". The word "MH" is in front of the URL. "MH" is either "AT" or "IT". In my opinion it´s more likely that it´s "AT". 
So I assume the following: 

    M = A
    T = I

So all in all: 

    B = S
    Y = R
    I = E
    D = H
    H = T
    M = A
    T = I

First approach to read the correct text: 

THAT'S IT. KWU'RE AWR WSSIOIMJJK A OWQENREALER! AS KWU SEE, STGPJE SUNSHTHUHTWA OTPDERS OAA NE NRWLEA RTHD SREEUEAOK MAMJKSTS. SEE KWU AT HTTP://TERWLARCTAEA.OWG

"KWU" most likely is "YOU".

    K = Y
    W = O
    U = U
    
So: 

THAT'S IT. YOU'RE AOR OSSIOIMJJY A OWQENREALER! AS YOU SEE, STGPJE SUNSHTHUHTOA OTPDERS OAA NE NROLEA RTHD SREEUEAOK MAMJYSTS. SEE YOU AT HTTP://TEROLARCTAEA.OOG

The ending of the URL is xOy. That´s most likely "COM".

    O = C
    G = M

THAT'S IT. YOU'RE ACR OSSIOIMJJY A COQENREALER! AS YOU SEE, STGPJE SUNSHTHUHTOA OTPDERS OAA NE NROLEA RTHD SREEUEAOK MAMJYSTS. SEE YOU AT HTTP://TEROLARCTAEA.COM

The URL is probably TEROKARVINEN.COM.
So "LARCTAEA" is "KARVINEN".

    L = K
    C = V
    T = I
    A = N

THAT'S IT. YOU'RE AVR OSSIOIMJJY A CWQENREAKER! AS YOU SEE, STGPJE SUNSHTHUHTOA OTPDERS OAA NE NROLEA RTHD SREEUEAOK MAMJYSTS. SEE YOU AT HTTP://TEROKARVINEN.COM

    R = B
    Q = D

THAT'S IT. YOU'RE ACR OSSIOIMJJY A CODEBREAKER! AS YOU SEE, STGPJE SUNSHTHUHTOA OTPDERS OAA NE NROLEA RTHD SREEUEAOK MAMJYSTS. SEE YOU AT HTTP://TEROKARVINEN.COM   

    S = F
    J = L

THAT'S IT. YOU'RE ACR OFFICIALLY A CODEBREAKER! AS YOU SEE, STGPLE SUNSHTHUHTOA OTPDERS OAA NE NROLEA RTHD SREEUEAOK MAMLYSTS. SEE YOU AT HTTP://TEROKARVINEN.COM 


I didn´t switch all letters of the ciphertext with the original letters. I have to think of a clearer and more structured way of 
deciphering.
