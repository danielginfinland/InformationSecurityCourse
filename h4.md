## Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: Chapter 1: Foundations

- Plaintext is encrypted to ciphertext. The ciphertext is then decrypted to the original plaintext.
- encrypt = encipher
- decrypt = decipher

## Drug deals
Market places: 
- Cryptomarkets
- vendor shops
- drug image board
- closed messaging app groups

typical buyer is recreational user

high risk business: that why there also are some trust mechanics: 
- recommendations
- feedback
- escrow

average buyer thinks: 
- trading is anonymous in TOR-browsing
- excrow is not trust-worthy
- trust their small purchase sizes

trust
- image by the store (use right nickname - not same one as on Insta, Fb, Tinder, ...; good marketing)
- outright racism - only selling to Finns as a Finn
- convenience - rule of least effort

buyers: 
- ethnicity (only to countrymen)
- age - they do not sell to minors (ethical or because of hard punishment)
- language - right kind of language (enough spelling mistakes and the right use of slang) --> posts with no spelling mistakes are likely posts by law-enforcement ("Moi Coppo")
