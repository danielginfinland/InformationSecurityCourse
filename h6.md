## Quintin 2014: 
1. Tor Still Works
2. Tor is Not Only Used by Criminals
3. Tor Does Not Have a Military Backdoor
4. No One in the US Has Been Prosecuted For Running a Tor Relay
5. Tor is Easy to Use
6. Tor is Not as Slow as You Think
7. Tor is Not Foolproof

## Shavers & Bair 2016: 

Tor hides users IP address. So it´s almost impossible to trace the user. 
Tor´s purpose is anonymous communication on the Internet. It also allows the conncection to censored or blocked websites. Tor was build by the US government in 2002, but now they do not control it. Nowadays they try to deanonymize users of Tor.
Tor leads the the route of internet traffic through different relays. First the data is secured with elliptic curve cryptography. The encrypted data will be led through 3 layers to the desired webpage.

--> Analogy: Sending a letter in an envelope which is placed in an envelope which is placed in an envelope which is placed in an envelope.

--> like an onion with many layers

How to track criminals in the darknet: Do not change any settings in the TOR browser. Do not allow webpages to see your IP address. Do not allow TOR browser to see you geolocation. A possible compromising can be done through a man-in-the-middle-attack. Tracking a user of TOR browser is also possible with an email-tracking. 

# a) Installation of TOR browser

First step is visiting the TOR website: https://www.torproject.org/download/
Then I downloaded the TOR browser for Linux.

After executing these commands I could open TOR browser and saved the shortcut on the desktop.

# b) Browsing TOR network
- search engines
  As search engine for the darkent I chose Ahmia.

- marketplace
  
  There are several marketplaces in the darknet, especially for drug selling. With a few clicks I found this page where cannabis in different forms is offered.

  On the same website I also found offers for cocaine.

Also, weapons are available.

- a site of a well-known organization
  
  Some well-known organizations and companies also have websites on the darknet, e.g. BBC, The Guardian and CIA.

# d) Bitcoin address in the darknet

To get the bitcoin address of the vendor, I pretend to buy a product of the website.

I don´t use my real personal information. Never use information that leads to you or is similar to yours!

![grafik](https://github.com/danielginfinland/InformationSecurityCourse/assets/156656492/9cf43cd5-55ce-46e7-87ef-7b703b036b4f)

On the first website I could not see the bitcoin address. So, I tried another website and there I could see it immediately.

To see the balance and the transactions of the bitcoin address I check it with Bitcoin Explorer: https://www.blockchain.com/de/explorer

The balance of this account is 0$.
