### Security Misconfiguration 
Threat Modeling Manifesto: https://www.threatmodelingmanifesto.org/

    Threat Modeling: analyzing data security and privacy in a system
    
    Questions:
    What´s our work?
    What could possibly go wrong?
    What is our approach to prevent this?
    Have we done a good job?
    
    What can happen in the stage of designing a system but also in later stages? How can these threats be prevented?
    How to use the model?
    
    Values: has relative worth, merit, or importance
    Principles: describes the fundamental truths; There are three types of principles: (i) fundamental, primary, or general truths that enable successful threat modeling, (ii) patterns that are highly recommended, and (iii) anti-patterns that should be avoided.
    
    Values: It´s everyones job to find and fix design issue with continuity and engagement
    
    Principles: 
    early and frequent analysis of threats
    outcomes of threat modeling are meaningful when they are of value to stakeholders
    Communications is key for improvement
    
    Do: Diverse team; Using tools; Use field-tested techniques
    Do not: everybody is able to do threat modeling; reach for practical and relevant solutions; Do not lose sight of the big picture; create multiple threat modeling representations


### Why Threat Modeling Tutorial 
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCVhBqLDKoOOZqKt74QI4pbDUnXSQo0nf


    anticipation of problem when it´s not expensive to deal with it

    easy changes possible
    secure from start on
    set of methods
    4 questions of Threat Modeling: same as in Security Misconfiguration
    collaboration is important, several people can work simultaneously on Threat Modeling
    sketching of system
    use a document of record, best in drawing tool, track your work
    What can go wrong? is an important first question
    use structured way: STRIDE - Spoofing - Tampering - Repudiation - Information Disclosure - Denial of Service - Elevation of Privileges

### Threat Modeling Cheat Sheet

    Get an owerview
    Ask yourself the 4 question (as in Security Misconfiguration)
    Then ask yourself: Why do I use TM? What are the advantages of using it?
    Understand data flows, trust boundaries and the system´s characteristics
    Identify risks early in design stage
    
    Mitigate: reduce the likelihood that threat will occure
    
    Eliminate: remove the feature or component that is causing the threat
    
    Transfer: shift responsibility to another entity such as the customer
    
    Accept: none of the above options are acceptable given business requirements or restrictions
