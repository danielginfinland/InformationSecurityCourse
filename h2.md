### Security Misconfiguration 
Threat Modeling Manifesto: https://www.threatmodelingmanifesto.org/

    Threat Modeling: analyzing data security and privacy in a system
    
    Questions:
    What´s our work?
    What could possibly go wrong?
    What is our approach to prevent this?
    Have we done a good job?
    
    What can happen in the stage of designing a system but also in later stages? How can these threats be prevented?
    How to use the model?
    
    Values: has relative worth, merit, or importance
    Principles: describes the fundamental truths; There are three types of principles: (i) fundamental, primary, or general truths that enable successful threat modeling, (ii) patterns that are highly recommended, and (iii) anti-patterns that should be avoided.
    
    Values: It´s everyones job to find and fix design issue with continuity and engagement
    
    Principles: 
    early and frequent analysis of threats
    outcomes of threat modeling are meaningful when they are of value to stakeholders
    Communications is key for improvement
    
    Do: Diverse team; Using tools; Use field-tested techniques
    Do not: everybody is able to do threat modeling; reach for practical and relevant solutions; Do not lose sight of the big picture; create multiple threat modeling representations


### Why Threat Modeling Tutorial 
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCVhBqLDKoOOZqKt74QI4pbDUnXSQo0nf


    anticipation of problem when it´s not expensive to deal with it
    pre-think system before coding
    easy changes possible
    secure from start on
    set of methods
    4 questions of Threat Modeling: same as in Security Misconfiguration
    collaboration is important, several people can work simultaneously on Threat Modeling
    sketching of system
    use a document of record, best in drawing tool, track your work
    What can go wrong? is an important first question
    use structured way: STRIDE - Spoofing - Tampering - Repudiation - Information Disclosure - Denial of Service - Elevation of Privileges
    Would you recommend TM to a colleague? If yes, TM is successful. If not, you haven´t done a good enough job


### Chapter 1 - Dive In and Threat Model!

    Find and anticipate threats
    TM is a practicality, not that much a theory --> Learning by doing!


### Threat Modeling Cheat Sheet

    Get an owerview
    Ask yourself the 4 question (as in Security Misconfiguration)
    Then ask yourself: Why do I use TM? What are the advantages of using it?
    Understand data flows, trust boundaries and the system´s characteristics
    Identify risks early in design stage
    
    Mitigate: reduce the likelihood that threat will occure
    
    Eliminate: remove the feature or component that is causing the threat
    
    Transfer: shift responsibility to another entity such as the customer
    
    Accept: none of the above options are acceptable given business requirements or restrictions


## a) Security hygiene

my own thoughts
https://www.linkedin.com/advice/3/how-can-you-configure-advanced-security-features

Everyone should do that: 

    installation of anti-virus software
    using a strong password
    back up important information
    secure WIFI connection
    limit social network information
    no disclosure of user names, e-mail addresses or passwords
    change passwords from time to time
    use a password manager
    don´t use a password multiple times
    keep updating applications and software
    use 2FA
    keep track of your bank and credit card transactions

   This is for advanced users: 

       use encryption of data
       use VPN connection


## b) Thread Modeling on the example of the fictive Daniel´s Company 


The company´s name in this case study is Daniel´s Company. Stakeholders are the board, the employees and the customers. Daniel´s Company sells B2C software solutions. These include and application with several additional licences that the customers may buy.
The application helps the customer to structure their day, shows their calendar and includes their email programme. 
The company was founded 1 month ago and is in the start phase. The application is not programmed yet but the idea does already exist. 
The personnel and the board are still figuring out what solution would be best.
For using the app the user has to allow access to this data: email-address, google calender, contacts, camera, audio, microphone, photos and videos.

The company is now thinking of how to use a Threat Model. 

### 1st question: What are we working on?

Our values and principles are: 
- Everyone who´s in charge of business operations has the continuisly job to look for threats, report them and fix them.
- Customers´ data security is important. The stealing of customers´ sensitive data shall be avoided and prevented.
- Weekly meeting where everyone can tell their ideas how to implement data security in the company.

### 2nd question: What can go wrong?

STRIDE
S like Spoofing: e.g. Phishing emails
T like Tampering: e.g. changing data without authorization
R like Repudiation: bad actor attacks the system and denies involvment; e.g. via emails
I like Information Disclosure: application or website leaks data to unauthorized persons; possible with wrong code or not-secured code files.
D like Denial of Service: attacks restrict authorized users from authorized access; stops continuity in processes; possible with DoS attacks
E like Elevation of Privileges: user has unauthorized access to others´ personal data; possbible with missed authorization check

An expected happening os Spoofing. It´s a really easy way to attack the system. The Daniel´s company buys a license of an email solution that rejects phisihing mails. 
Also DoS is really probable. The expected value of this attack will be 0.1 % * 75,000 €/d = 7,500 €/d. The high price of 75,000 is because of the loss of trust of the customer in the company and the reliability of it. 
Tampering is quite likely. Every employee has to have only the rights of access that they need. They also have to be aware of data security and that it´s possible to attack a company via email. 
At the moment the most important aspect of data security in Daniel´s Company is the Information Disclosure. The programming of the app must be checked once a week if the code contains loopholes to see secret customer data. If a customer is suing the Daniel´s Company for insufficient data security, the company has to pay the fee. With approximately 10 sues untill the problem is solved and a probability of 5 % we come to a value of 0.1 * 10 * 10,000 = 10,000.
