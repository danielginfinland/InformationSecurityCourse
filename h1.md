# Homework 1

## x) The Beirut Bankjob

Jason is a specialist in Security Awareness Engagements
He tests the physical security of various places, as well as banks. 
He aims to gain access to sensitive information (e.g. teller´s computer); He will not steal money or install destructive software on the teller´s PC
Jason tells about a specific incident where he was hired to test the physical security of a bank in Beirut, Lebanon. 
He successfully gained access to the teller´s working space, infiltrated the bank, compromised computers, and even managed to convince the bank manager to let him access the vault. 
Jason shares his techniques, including social engineering, forging documents, and using a USB rubber ducky for testing vulnerabilities. With the rubber ducky he can get fast access to the bank´s computers and can control them.
After that Jason talked about another job in Beirut. His job was also to infiltrate a bank. The story takes an unexpected turn when Jason accidentally enters the wrong bank. After some actions in this bank, he was eventually caught. Therefore, he must explain his actions to the bank's security team. 
Jason´s tips for companies’ security are: be skeptical and in case inform supervisors; be aware and stay informed of security issues and threats, skepticism, and verification in preventing unauthorized access, be aware that bad guys do not always wear ski masks and have guns but also can threat the company through their system  associate locations in banks with money


### Abstract
### 3.2 Intrusion Kill Chain
Reconnaissance: Identification and selection of target, research: mailing lists, social relationships
Weaponization: Coupling a remote access trojan in an automated tool; often uses: PDF, Microsoft application formats
Delivery: weapon must be transmitted, especially by email attachments, websites and usb removable media
Exploitation: triggers intruder´s code; e.g. running an application, executing code
Installation: installs trojan on victims PC for remote access for persistence inside in victim´s PC
Command and Control: intruder installs system on victim´s PC to control it and execute code
Actions on Objectives: collection, encryption and extraction of victim´s data; victim´s PC can also be used as hop point to other PCs stated in the same network

### 3.3 Courses of Action Matrix
In each phase of the kill chain, there are actions can be done by the company itself. Each kind of defense is described by on of the 7 D´s: Detect, Deny, Disrupt, Degrade, Deceive, Destroy
