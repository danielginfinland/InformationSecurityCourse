### The Beirut Bank Job

Jason is a specialist in Security Awareness Engagements
He tests the physical security of various places, as well as banks. 
He aims to gain access to sensitive information (e.g. teller´s computer); He will not steal money or install destructive software on the teller´s PC
Jason tells about a specific incident where he was hired to test the physical security of a bank in Beirut, Lebanon. 
He successfully gained access to the teller´s working space, infiltrated the bank, compromised computers, and even managed to convince the bank manager to let him access the vault. 
Jason shares his techniques, including social engineering, forging documents, and using a USB rubber ducky for testing vulnerabilities. With the rubber ducky he can get fast access to the bank´s computers and can control them.
After that Jason talked about another job in Beirut. His job was also to infiltrate a bank. The story takes an unexpected turn when Jason accidentally enters the wrong bank. After some actions in this bank, he was eventually caught. Therefore, he must explain his actions to the bank's security team. 
Jason´s tips for companies’ security are: be skeptical and in case inform supervisors; be aware and stay informed of security issues and threats, skepticism, and verification in preventing unauthorized access, be aware that bad guys do not always wear ski masks and have guns but also can threat the company through their system  associate locations in banks with money

### Intelligence-Driven Computer Network Defense Informed by Analysis of Adversary Campaigns and Intrusion Kill Chains

### Abstract 
•	Traditional network defense tools (intrusion detection systems, anti-virus) focus on vulnerabilities, assuming successful intrusions.

•	Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are highly skilled attackers who run long-term campaigns targeting important information.

•	APTs use advanced techniques that can bypass normal defense tools.

•	Intelligence-driven Computer Network Defense (CND) focuses on understanding these attackers, creating a loop of learning for defenders.

•	Defenders use a "kill chain" model to map out how attackers operate and then plan ways to stop them at each stage.

•	This approach reduces the chances of attackers succeeding, helps prioritize defense efforts, and measures how well the defense is working.

•	This method not only fixes weaknesses but also deals with the threat posed by APTs.


### 3.2 Intrusion Kill Chain
Reconnaissance: Identification and selection of target, research: mailing lists, social relationships

Weaponization: Coupling a remote access trojan in an automated tool; often uses: PDF, Microsoft application formats

Delivery: weapon must be transmitted, especially by email attachments, websites and usb removable media

Exploitation: triggers intruder´s code; e.g. running an application, executing code

Installation: installs trojan on victims PC for remote access for persistence inside in victim´s PC

Command and Control: intruder installs system on victim´s PC to control it and execute code

Actions on Objectives: collection, encryption and extraction of victim´s data; victim´s PC can also be used as hop point to other PCs stated in the same network


### 3.3 Courses of Action Matrix
•	The Courses of Action Model measures the performance of the action to defend cybersecurity attacks. 

•	In each phase of the kill chain, there are actions can be done by the company itself. Each kind of defense is described by one of the 6 D´s: Detect, Deny, Disrupt, Degrade, Deceive, Destroy. 

•	Being complete in defense means being strong and resilient against persistent enemies.

•	Zero-day exploits are tactics used by adversaries to attack the victim

•	Just focusing on stopping zero-day attacks is not enough; there´s a need to look at the complete picture of how intruders operate.

•	Even if intruders use a new kind of attack, it's useless if we already know how to stop their following moves.

•	We can measure how well defenses are working by checking how they perform against intruders.

•	An example is given about a seven-month attack, showing how defenses improved over time.

•	The goal is to make it expensive for intruders to succeed by fixing weaknesses in our defenses.

## o) What are the fundaments of Information Security?

Setting rules for actions to do in certain scenarios; also setting concrete procedures
Be aware of the various aspects of security lacks in a company (e.g. humans, access to computers and computer systems, tools and system in use like Email traffic)
Be aware of the simplicity of gaining access to sensitive information
